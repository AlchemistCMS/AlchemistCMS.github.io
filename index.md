## Welcome to AlchemistCMS

We are in a pretty Early Stage.

- Technology: Elixir, Phoenix framework and OTP.

- Considering ReactJs for frontend.
- It will be an Umbrella app, like a SaaS and focused on standard practices.

- When logged in as an site-admin, you will have a backend through which you can modify page content and template.
- Quickly create landing pages or a basing (3 field) simple form.

- You can choose a template for how page visitor will see it or add a completely custom CSS and template.

## Use cases

### Case 1: Realtime votes / Multiple choice quizzes.

### Case 2: SaaS like custom domains for landing page & easy form for feedback/survey/voting.

### Case 3: Dashboard showing realtime or filter based answers. 

### show realtime count of visitors.

### One time password or TOTP to verify the visitor is real.

We want to make it generic so people can fork it and extend to customize for their use.

I have invited a few people to contribute. Inviting you too.
