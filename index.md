## Welcome to AlchemistCMS

We are in a pretty Early Stage.
We want to create a CMS intended for realtime Audience.

- [Code Repository](https://github.com/AlchemistCMS/alchemist-umbrella)
- [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/AlchemistCMS/projects/1)

- Technology: Elixir-lang Phoenix framework and OTP.

- Considering ReactJs/Phoenix Liveview for frontend.
- It will be an Umbrella app, like a SaaS and focused on standard practices.

- When logged in as an site-admin, you will have a backend through which you can modify page content and template.
- Quickly create landing pages
- Create A basic (3 field) simple form.
- conduct Realtime Quiz/competitions. Think of live webinar Audience.
- send mail with report of Event and Audience.

- You can choose a template for how page visitor will see it or add a completely custom CSS and template.

## Features

### Realtime votes / Multiple choice quizzes.

### SaaS like custom domains for landing page & easy form for feedback/survey/voting.

### Dashboard showing realtime or filter based answers. 

### Show realtime count of visitors.

### One time password or TOTP to verify the visitor is real.

We want to make it generic so people can fork it and extend to customize for their use.

## I have invited a few people to contribute. Inviting you too.
